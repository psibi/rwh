## Solutions to problems in [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/) book

My attempt to solve the exercises in the book as I read through each
chapter of the book.

Note: Some exercises may be unsolved as of now because I'm too lazy to
think but I will definitely return back to them at some point!

### Current Status

* Chapter 1: Complete
* Chapter 2: Complete
* Chapter 3: Three problems remaining. (Page 70: Ex 11, 12 & 13)
* Chapter 4: Two Problems remaining. (Page 84: Ex 3, 4 & Page 98: Ex
  8, 9, 10)
* Chapter 5: Argh! All problems remaining.
